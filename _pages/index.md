## Hey everyone!

We are a group of IB students who have created this website to share our notes with the world and other IB Students! 

For now we are still developing our website and are mainly focusing on notes for Group 3 & 4 subjects but we are working on the rest as well. 

The subjects we have some notes on right now:
- [Economics](/g3/economics)

The subjects we are still working on:
- [History](/g3/history) 
- [Business Management](/g3/business-management) 
- [Biology](/g4/biology)
- [Physics](/g4/physics)

In this website we will also be posting [General Tips and Tricks](/tips) on how to manage the IB Life and post guidelines on how to proceed with the core subjects: [TOK](/tok), [EE](/ee) and [CAS](/cas). So stay tuned for further updates!
